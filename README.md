# LHL Node Skeleton

## Project Setup

The following steps are only for _one_ of the group members to perform.

1. Create your own copy of this repo using the `Use This Template` button, ideally using the name of your project. The repo should be marked Public
2. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub, you should be automatically redirected
3. Clone your copy of the repo to your dev machine
4. Add your team members as collaborators to the project so that they can push to this repo
5. Let your team members know the repo URL so that they use the same repo (they should _not_ create a copy/fork of this repo since that will add additional workflow complexity to the project)

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- username: `labber`
- password: `labber`
- database: `midterm`

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

7. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
- NPM 5.x or above
- PG 6.x





# Graigslist

## Overview

Graigslist is an app that allows fictitious users to create items for sale, have those items saved to a database, and then display them on various pages. The items can be searched for and favourited by a user, and an owner for an item can delete or mark their items as sold. As well, a messaging app has been created for the site to allow users and owners to interact with one another.

This app was created as a Lighthouse Labs midterm project whose contributors are:
- Dustin Grof (dustingrof)
- Emily Bozek (feltfan)
- Dave McKinnon (mckinnondave)

## Features

Users can:
- View featured listings on the homepage
- Click on a product's name and be redirected to that product's page
- View items in various categories
- Search for items through a search bar
- Sort items by price (high-to-low or low-to-high)

Account Owners can:
- Do all that a non-account user can plus:
  - Login
  - View their profile
  - Create a new listing
  - "Like" products to save for later viewing
  - Delete items they have posted
  - Mark items as sold (which is shown on all other pages showing the item)
  - Start or join conversations with other account owners
